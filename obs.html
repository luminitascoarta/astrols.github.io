		 <br>
		 <span class="obs_p">The Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) are a number of independent astronomical 
		 research facilities and large telescope observatories that are located at the 
		 summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii, United States. 
		 <br><br>The facilities 
		 are located in a 525-acre (212 ha) special land use zone known as the "Astronomy 
		 Precinct", which is located within the 11,228-acre (4,544 ha) Mauna Kea Science 
		 Reserve.

		 <span class="obs_span" style="margin-left:15%;">University of Tokyo Atacama Observatory</span>
		 
		 <span class="obs_p" style="margin-left:15%;">The University of Tokyo Atacama Observatory (TAO) is an astronomical 
		 observatory located on the summit of Cerro Chajnantor, at an altitude of 5,640 m (18,500 ft) 
		 within a lava dome in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The site is located less than 5 
		 km (3.1 mi) north-northeast of the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory, where the Atacama Large Millimeter 
		 Array (ALMA) is located, but is over 580 m (1,900 ft) higher in elevation
		 <br><br>The eventual goal of the project is to install a 6.5 m (260 in) optical-infrared telescope at the 
		 site.

		 <span class="obs_span">Atacama Cosmology Telescope</span>
		 <br>
		 <span class="obs_p">The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is a six-metre telescope on Cerro Toco in the 
		 Atacama Desert in the north of Chile, near the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory. It is designed to make 
		 high-resolution, microwave-wavelength surveys of the sky in order to study the cosmic microwave background 
		 radiation (CMB). At an altitude of 5190 metres (17,030 feet), it is one of the highest permanent, ground-based 
		 telescopes in the world
		 <br><br>Erected in the (austral) autumn of 2007, ACT saw first light on 22 October 2007 with its science receiver, 
		 the Millimeter Bolometer Array Camera (MBAC), and completed its first season in December 2007. It began its second 
		 season of observations in June 2008.

		 <span class="obs_p" style="margin-left:15%;">The Large Millimetre Telescope (LMT) (Spanish: Gran Telescopio 
		 Milimétrico, or GTM) is the world's largest single-aperture telescope in its frequency range, built for 
		 observing radio waves in the wave lengths from approximately 0.85 to 4 mm. It has an active surface with 
		 a diameter of 50 metres (160 ft) and 1,960 square metres (21,100 sq ft) of collecting area.
		 <br><br>It is located at an altitude of 4850 meters on top of the Sierra Negra, the fifth highest peak in 
		 Mexico and an extinct volcanic companion to Mexico's highest mountain, the Pico de Orizaba, inside the 
		 National Park Pico de Orizaba in the state of Puebla.

		 <span class="obs_span">Sphinx Observatory</span>
		 <br>
		 <span class="obs_p">The Sphinx Observatory is an astronomical observatory located above the Jungfraujoch 
		 in Switzerland. It is named after the Sphinx, a rocky summit on which it is located. At 3,571 m (11,716 ft) 
		 above mean sea level, it is one of the highest observatories in the world. Accessible to the public, it is 
		 also the second highest observation deck in Switzerland. The mountain top has been tunneled to fit an elevator 
		 which ascends to the observatory from the Jungfraujoch railway station, the highest such train station in Europe.
		 <br><br>The open viewing deck accessible to the public is adjacent to the observatory. 
		 It offers views of the Jungfrau, Mönch, and Eiger peaks, all within a few kilometers.
